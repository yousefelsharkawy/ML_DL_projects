# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

## [License Plates Reader](https://github.com/yousefelsharkawy/ML_DL_projects/tree/main/License_plate_reader)

![License Plates Reader Demo](License_plate_reader/assets/license_plate_intro.jpg)

- **Description**: This projects detects License plates and reads the characters on them. To ennhance robustness of the OCR, the project utilizes the detection and tracking of cars as will.

- **Technologies**: YOLOV8, OpenCV, Pytesseract, SORT

*Generated Caption by the model: A black and white dog is Jumping Over a bar*

- **Description**: This project Implements the [Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044) paper. The Project first preprocess the Flickr8k/Flickr30k datasets and constructs a vocabulary. Then, it trains a CNN (ResNet101) and an LSTM with an attention mechanism to generate captions for images.

- **Technologies**: Pytorch (ResNet101, LSTM, Attention Mechanism), BLEU Score, Flickr8k/Flickr30k Datasets, Spacy (Tokenizer)
